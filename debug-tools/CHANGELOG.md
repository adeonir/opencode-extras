# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin will be documented in this file.

## v1.4.0 (2026-02-04)

### Added

- **OpenCode Support**: Full migration from Claude Code to OpenCode
- **MCP Integration**: Support for optional MCP servers with automatic fallback
  - console-ninja: Runtime values capture
  - chrome-devtools: Browser inspection
  - serena: Semantic code analysis
  - context7: Documentation search
- **Agent Optimizations**:
  - debug-investigator: 15 steps, MCP-aware with fallback
  - debug-logger: 12 steps, streamlined log injection
- **Automatic MCP Detection**: Command detects available MCPs and adapts workflow

### Changed

- **Workflow**: Enhanced 5-phase workflow with MCP support
- **Tools**: Agents use bash/read/grep/webfetch as fallback when MCPs unavailable
- **Documentation**: Updated README with MCP configuration examples
- **Naming**: Commands and agents use opencode conventions (`/debug`, `@debug-investigator`)
