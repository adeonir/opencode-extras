description: Generate task list from technical plan

# Tasks Command

Transform the technical plan into an organized, trackable task list.

## Arguments

- `[ID]` - Feature ID (optional if branch is associated)

Arguments received: $ARGUMENTS

## Process

### Step 1: Resolve Feature

If ID provided:

- Use that feature directly

If no ID:

- Get current git branch
- Search `.specs/*/spec.md` for matching `branch:` in frontmatter
- If found, use that feature
- If not found:
  - If only one feature exists, use it
  - If multiple, list them and ask user to specify

### Step 2: Load Specification

Read `.specs/{ID}-{feature}/spec.md` to have access to:

- Functional requirements (FR-xxx)
- Acceptance criteria (AC-xxx)

### Step 3: Load Plan

Read `.specs/{ID}-{feature}/plan.md`

If file doesn't exist, inform user to run `/spec-plan` first.

### Step 4: Detect Quality Gate Commands

Read `package.json` to find:

- Package manager (check for lockfiles: pnpm-lock.yaml, yarn.lock, bun.lockb, package-lock.json)
- Lint script (look for: `lint`, `check`)
- Typecheck script (look for: `typecheck`, `type-check`, `check:types`)

### Step 5: Generate Tasks

Invoke the `@spec/tasker` agent with:

- The specification (spec.md) with requirements
- The technical plan (plan.md)
- Feature ID and name
- Quality gate commands detected from package.json

The agent will create `.specs/{ID}-{feature}/tasks.md` with:

- Sequential IDs (T001, T002...)
- Dependency markers [P] and [B:Txxx]
- Component groups (each with setup, types, implementation, tests in natural order)
- Checkboxes for tracking
- Quality gates instruction
- Requirements coverage table

### Step 6: Report

Inform the user:

- Tasks created at `.specs/{ID}-{feature}/tasks.md`
- Next step: `/spec-implement` to start implementation

Show a summary:

```
## Task Summary

Total: 9 tasks
Run `/spec-implement` to start, or `/spec-implement T001` for a specific task.
```

## Error Handling

- **Feature not found**: List available features or suggest `/spec-init`
- **Plan not found**: Inform user to run `/spec-plan` first
- **Plan incomplete**: Point out missing sections, suggest updating plan
