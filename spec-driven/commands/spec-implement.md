# Implement Command

Execute tasks from the task list, respecting dependencies and updating progress.

## Arguments

| Input       | Action                                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `[ID]`      | Feature ID (optional if branch is associated) |
| (empty)     | Next pending task                             |
| `T001`      | Single task                                   |
| `T001-T005` | Range of tasks                                |
| `--all`     | All pending tasks                             |

Arguments received: $ARGUMENTS

## Process

### Step 1: Resolve Feature

Parse arguments to extract:

- Feature ID (if provided as first numeric arg or `XXX-name` format)
- Task scope (T001, T001-T005, --all, or empty)

If no ID:

- Get current git branch
- Search `.specs/*/spec.md` for matching `branch:` in frontmatter
- If found, use that feature
- If not found:
  - If only one feature exists, use it
  - If multiple, list them and ask user to specify

### Step 2: Load Context

Read from `.specs/{ID}-{feature}/`:

- `spec.md` - Requirements (extract Acceptance Criteria section)
- `plan.md` - Technical decisions and Critical Files
- `tasks.md` - Task list and progress

Check `docs/research/` for any referenced research files.

If plan.md or tasks.md don't exist, inform user to run `/spec-plan` and `/spec-tasks` first.

### Step 3: Update Status

If status is `ready` or `draft`:

- Update spec.md frontmatter to `status: in-progress`

### Step 4: Load Critical Files

From plan.md, identify the `## Critical Files` section.

For the tasks about to execute:

- Read the **Reference Files** relevant to current tasks (max 5 files)
- These provide patterns and conventions to follow

### Step 5: Parse Scope

Determine which tasks to execute based on arguments.

### Step 6: Validate Dependencies

For each task to execute:

- If marked `[P]`, can proceed
- If marked `[B:Txxx]`, check if Txxx is completed
- Skip blocked tasks, inform user

### Step 7: Execute Tasks

Invoke the `@spec-implementer` agent with:

- Task scope
- Specification (Acceptance Criteria section)
- Technical plan
- Research summary (if exists)
- Current task list
- Reference file contents
- Feature ID and name

The agent will:

- Implement each task following the plan
- Validate against acceptance criteria
- Follow patterns from reference files
- Update tasks.md with checkboxes
- Suggest atomic commits

### Step 8: Check Completion

After execution, check if ALL tasks are completed.

If all tasks done:

- Update spec.md frontmatter to `status: to-review`
- Inform user that implementation is complete

### Step 9: Report

After execution:

- Show tasks completed
- Show files created/modified
- Show remaining tasks (if any)
- Suggest commit message
- If all done: suggest `/spec-validate` for final review
- If tasks remain: suggest continuing with `/spec-implement`

## Error Handling

- **Feature not found**: List available features or suggest `/spec-init`
- **Plan/tasks not found**: Inform user to run previous commands
- **Dependency blocked**: List which tasks need to complete first
- **Implementation error**: Report issue, keep task unchecked
