# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin will be documented in this file.

## v2.6.0 (2026-01-31)

### Added

- Test Infrastructure Discovery step in `explorer` agent
  - Discovers test framework via config files (jest, vitest, pytest, etc.)
  - Locates test directories, shared utilities, fixtures, helpers, and mocks
  - Documents how to run tests and finds reference tests for similar features
- Test Strategy section in `architect` plan output
  - Existing Infrastructure table (framework, directory, utilities, run command)
  - Reference Tests table (patterns to follow from similar features)
  - New Tests table (components, files, scenarios)

### Changed

- Task grouping is now a flat list with adjacency-based grouping (blank lines between groups)
  - No more section headers (Foundation, Implementation, etc.)
  - Related tasks (types, implementation, tests) are always adjacent
  - Component-specific deps belong next to the code that uses them
- `/plan` command no longer runs inline validation (removed Step 8)
  - Suggests `/spec-driven:validate` as optional step in the report
- `architect` process now analyzes test patterns from explorer output

### Removed

- Inline plan validation step from `/plan` command (use `/spec-driven:validate` instead)
- Category-based task sections (Foundation, Implementation, Documentation)
- Generic "Testing: {strategy}" field from architect Considerations

## v2.5.3 (2026-01-25)

### Changed

- `/init` now enforces strict content separation between spec.md and plan.md
  - spec.md: WHAT to build (requirements, acceptance criteria)
  - plan.md: HOW to build (architecture, files, implementation)
  - tasks.md: WHEN to build (ordered tasks with dependencies)
- Brownfield baseline now describes behavior only, no file paths or code
- Task grouping by component: related tasks (types, implementation, tests if any) are grouped together for atomic commits
- Quality gates run after each task, not as separate final tasks
- Removed assumption that all projects have tests

### Fixed

- spec.md was including implementation details (file paths, code, technology choices)
- Tasks were being separated from related work (e.g., component far from its tests)

## v2.5.2 (2026-01-18)

### Added

- Quality Gates in tasks.md output
  - Detects lint/typecheck scripts from package.json
  - Adds instruction to run quality checks after each task
- Implementer now runs quality gates after each task, tries `--fix` flag first, then fixes remaining manually

### Changed

- `/tasks` command now reads package.json to detect quality gate commands

## v2.5.1 (2026-01-18)

### Added

- Project Conventions Discovery step in `explorer` agent
  - Identifies wrapper libraries/abstractions the project uses
  - Documents patterns that MUST be followed (with reference files)
  - Documents what to avoid (e.g., direct access when abstraction exists)
- "Project conventions" as mandatory output item in explorer analysis

### Changed

- Rule 4 in explorer now emphasizes explicit documentation of conventions

## v2.5.0 (2026-01-12)

### Added

- Brownfield support in `/init` command
  - Auto-detects greenfield vs brownfield based on keywords and codebase analysis
  - Generates Baseline section for brownfield specs (related files, current behavior, modification points)
  - New `type: greenfield | brownfield` field in spec.md frontmatter
- Multi-mode validation in `/validate` command
  - Mode Spec: validates spec structure (after /init)
  - Mode Plan: + documentation compliance (after /plan)
  - Mode Tasks: + requirements coverage (after /tasks)
  - Mode Full: + code validation (after /implement)
  - Auto-detects mode based on available artifacts

### Changed

  - `code-architect` -> `architect`
  - `task-generator` -> `tasker`

## v2.4.0 (2026-01-12)

### Added

- `plan-validator` agent to validate plan.md against project documentation
- Plan validation step in `/plan` command (Step 8)

## v2.3.3 (2026-01-12)

### Fixed

- `code-architect` marks undocumented decisions as `[NOT DOCUMENTED - needs verification]`

## v2.3.2 (2026-01-07)

### Fixed

- Status update timing in `/plan` command: now sets `ready` only after plan is generated

## v2.3.1 (2026-01-07)

### Changed

- Renamed status values for consistency:
  - `planning` -> `ready`
  - `review` -> `to-review`
